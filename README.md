# Disease Diagnosis Tool

## Overview

The Disease Diagnosis Tool is a web-based application designed to assist users in identifying potential respiratory diseases based on their symptoms. By asking a series of targeted questions, the tool uses a symptom checker to guide users toward possible conditions. The application now includes a machine learning model that predicts disease types based on user input.

## Features

- **Symptom Checker**: Users can answer questions about their symptoms to receive preliminary insights into possible diseases.
- **Disease Categories**: The tool categorizes diseases into groups: COVID, Obstructive, Upper Respiratory, and Lower Respiratory diseases.
- **Follow-up Questions**: Based on initial responses, the tool prompts users with additional questions tailored to their symptoms, allowing for more accurate diagnoses.
- **Dynamic Results**: The application displays potential diseases based on user input, providing a clear suggestion of what the user may have.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: A machine learning model has been implemented to enhance the accuracy of disease predictions based on symptom data.

## Planned Features

- **Expanded Disease Database**: Continuous updates will be made to the database of diseases to improve the tool's accuracy and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the web application.
- **JavaScript**: To handle user interactions and dynamically display content.
- **Machine Learning Framework**: Integrated for predictive capabilities.
